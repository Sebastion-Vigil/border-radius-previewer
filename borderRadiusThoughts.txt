**on mouse hover I want cursor to remain mouse and not vertical line -> solved with cursor: auto;
** prevent user from highlighting button text with user-select: none;

** Want to gradually increase increment/decrement speed from x to y speed
** in order to do that, I would have to increment the ms variable passed 
** to the setTimeout() method

** There's a lot more that could be done with this: 
** We could:
-- Allow the user to change size, color, and even type of shape.
-- Allow for multiple shapes to be viewed at once
-- Make the app responsive in mobile and tablet views
